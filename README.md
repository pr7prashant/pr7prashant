- 👋 Hi, I’m Prashant. I am an all round web developer with good knowledge of front-end techniques. Skilled in JavaScript, React.js, Express.js, Node.js, and some other javascript libraries. I love learning different technologies and using them to make well structured applications. I also love optimizing the applications and fixing minor issues which helps in the long run. I have experience working on projects in a team as well as individually. Other than programming, I spend most of my time playing/watching football.

- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on open source projects.

- 📫 You can reach out to me at pr7prashant@gmail.com
